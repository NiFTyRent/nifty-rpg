### Step 1 - Creating a Map

Once you click the button a window will be prompted to you. Whe are going to change the `Tile layer format` to `Base64 (uncompressed)` and the `tile size` to 16x16 just like the image below. Leave the rest as it is. Click on the `Save As...` button and save the map inside the `src/assets/maps/` folder, you should create a folder with your map name and save it inside this new folder.
