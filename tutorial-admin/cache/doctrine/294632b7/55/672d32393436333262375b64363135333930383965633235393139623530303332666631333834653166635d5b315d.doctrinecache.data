<h3>The Object Layers</h3>
<p>There is a reason why we have created so many Object Layers in our tile map. They all have a pourpose. We are going to use one of those to add the player to a desired position. It's preatty simple. </p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Object Layer on the Layers Panel. </li>
<li>Slect the <code>spawn</code> Object Layer.</li>
<li>Select the <code>Insert Point (I)</code>.</li>
<li>Place de <code>Insert Point</code> where you want the player to Spawn.</li>
<li>Name the <code>Insert Point</code> Object you just created as <code>Spawn Point</code>.</li>
<li>Export your map again to the same place you have already saved it, so your game knows your changes.</li>
<li>Run your Scnee again.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you followed all the steps carefully you should have the default player character placed where you defined the <code>Spawn Point</code>.</p>
