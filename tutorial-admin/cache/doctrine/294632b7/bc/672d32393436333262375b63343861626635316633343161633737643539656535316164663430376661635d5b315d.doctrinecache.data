<p>Now that we have a basic map we can start creating a more complex MAP using the multiple Layers that we have created. Lets clear everything that we have on our current Map and start over. Let's add another Tileset that the Template already uses <code>src/assets/maps/tilesets/Overworld-extruded.png</code>, it's an already extruded tileset, follow the same steps that we used on the <a href="/tiled/setting-up-tiled/creating-my-first-tileset">Step 4 - Creating My First Tileset</a></p>

<p>Before we start drawing anything I will teach you how to create Terrains. Actually, I will leave this job to Mike "My Buddy" (Actually I don't know him) to Teach you. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIYNuXdDClU&amp;ab_channel=Gamefromscratch%3Ftarget%3D_blank">How to Create Terrains on Tiled.</a></p>
<p>Having created your terrain, select it, and start to Draw your tiles on the <code>base</code> layer. I have created what I think is Sand (I don't know actually, but I call it Sand). </p>

<p>Now we are going to add a House, but beware that you can't use the base layer to draw it, otherwise the terrain tiles that you have used will be replaced by the house. That's Why we have created other layers to draw upon. Select the <code>overlay</code> layer and place the house on it.</p>
