<p>To add collision between the <code>Player</code>and the Map is really easy with the Luminus RPG. Fun fact is that I have started this project as a simple Proof of Concept if I could paint map colisions <a href="https://develop.gbstudio.dev/docs/scenes/">just like GB Studio</a> does. Up until now the folder name that stores this project is called <code>collision</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the layers tab on the Layers Panel.</li>
<li>Select the <code>collision</code> layer.</li>
<li>Create a new Property for the <code>collision</code> layer called <code>collides</code></li>
<li>Check the <code>collides</code>property.</li>
</ol>

<p>We are not finished yet. I like to use a special Tile to create collisions. As I said I was inspired by GB Studio's collision technique, so I have created a collision tile, a single red tile that represents the tiles that the player cant go. So let's add it to the Tiled Map.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
