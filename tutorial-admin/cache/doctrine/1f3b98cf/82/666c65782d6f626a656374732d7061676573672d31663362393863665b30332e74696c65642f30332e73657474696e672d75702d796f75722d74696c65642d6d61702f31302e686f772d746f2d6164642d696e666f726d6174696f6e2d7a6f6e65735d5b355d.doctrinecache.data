First of all, you have to create the actual chat in the `src/consts/DB_SEED/Chats.js`

This is the Structure of the object:

```
export const CHATS = [
    {
        id: 1,
        chat: [
                {
                    leftPortraitName: 'lucius_portrait_beardless', // Sprite name of the portrait that will be displayed at the left side. the sprite should be imported by the Assets Manager with this name.
                    leftName: 'Person Name', // The name that will be displayed at the left side of the dialog box.
                    left: true, // Should the left side Name and Portrait be displayed?
                    leftExit: false, // Optionally you can make the portrait move away, like the person is leaving, just set it to true.
                    message:
                        'Hello there!!', // the message that will be displayed at the dislog.
                    rightPortraitName: '', // Sprite name of the portrait that will be displayed at the right side. the sprite should be imported by the Assets Manager with this name.
                    rightName: '', // The name that will be displayed at the right side of the dialog box.
                    right: false, // Should the right side Name and Portrait be displayed?
                    rightExit: false, // Optionally you can make the portrait move away, like the person is leaving, just set it to true.
                },
                {
                    leftPortraitName: 'lucius_portrait_beardless', // Sprite name of the portrait that will be displayed at the left side. the sprite should be imported by the Assets Manager with this name.
                    leftName: 'Game Master', // The name that will be displayed at the left side of the dialog box.
                    left: true, // Is the left person talking? Then it will highlight the portrait and the name, if it's still visible, and false, it will dim the portrait and the name to indicate that this is not the person who is talking.
                    message:
                        'I'm leaving.', // the message that will be displayed at the dislog.
                    rightPortraitName: 'lucius_portrait_beard', // Sprite name of the portrait that will be displayed at the right side. the sprite should be imported by the Assets Manager with this name.
                    rightName: 'Right Name', // The name that will be displayed at the right side of the dialog box.
                    right: true, // Is the left person talking? Then it will highlight the portrait and the name, if it's still visible, and false, it will dim the portrait and the name to indicate that this is not the person who is talking.
                    rightExit: true, // Optionally you can make the portrait move away, like the person is leaving, just set it to true.
                },
            ]
	};

It's really easy to add information zones using the Luminus RPG System. Just select the `info` object layer and add a rectangle where the player will be able to interact with the zone. Set a property to this rectangle called `message` of type `string`, then add yous message there. The Luminus Dialog Scene takes care of the rest. Oh! Talking about it, don't forget to launch it on your Scene.

```
        this.scene.launch('DialogScene', {
            player: this.player,
            map: map.map,
            scene: this,
        });
```
