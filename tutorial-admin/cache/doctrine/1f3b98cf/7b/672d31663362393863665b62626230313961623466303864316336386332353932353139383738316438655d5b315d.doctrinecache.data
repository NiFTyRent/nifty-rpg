<p>You can also call it a Chat / Dialog as you can tell a whole Story with this.</p>

<p>It's really easy to add information zones using the Luminus RPG System. Just select the <code>info</code> object layer and add a rectangle where the player will be able to interact with the zone. Set a property to this rectangle called <code>messageID</code> of type <code>int</code>, then add the id of the conversation that you have just created. The Luminus Dialog Scene takes care of the rest. Oh! Talking about it, don't forget to launch it on your Scene.</p>
